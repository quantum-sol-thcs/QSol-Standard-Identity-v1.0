## Identity Model Overview

QID defines:

- A permanent identity anchor  
- A device‑bound secret used to generate resonance proofs  
- A zero‑knowledge authentication protocol  
- A recovery mechanism that preserves identity continuity  
- A rotation mechanism for cryptographic freshness  
- A governance model for institutional oversight  

Identity is permanent, but devices, witnesses, and credentials are rotatable.

## Implementation Profiles

This standard defines three normative profiles:

- **No‑Unlock Profile** — fully device‑bound, no user secret  
- **PIN Profile** — short user secret + device binding  
- **Passphrase Profile** — high‑entropy user secret + device binding  

Profiles define security guarantees, threat models, and conformance requirements.

## Certification & Conformance

The standard includes:

- Certification process  
- Auditor guidelines  
- Conformance test vectors  
- Determinism and mapping tests  
- Kernel‑level identity validation  

Implementations must pass the CTS to be considered QID‑compliant.
